# Web

Simple React frontend served with the `serve` package.
It fetches desks and bookings from the API and provides a small form to create new bookings.
The API base URL is `http://localhost:3000` during development.
Toggle the "Edit" button to drag desks around and the new positions will be saved via the API.
The page also displays daily and weekly booking counts from the analytics endpoints.
