# Web

React frontend built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Development

From this directory run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server on http://localhost:3001.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be placed in the `dist/` folder. You can preview the
production build with:

```bash
npm start
```

which serves the contents of `dist/` on the same port.
